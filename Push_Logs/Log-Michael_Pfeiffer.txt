	-Created Github reposetory along with an empty Android Studio activity in Java. The Android Platform Version(APV) is 5.1(lollipop) making the API level 22. Also created logging folder with an example.
	-The Github repository was made in order to share the project file with everyone in the group. The app will be made in Androids native language(Java) so we decided to use the Androis Studio IDE and so I created an empty project so everyone can get started right away. The Android Platform Version(APV) 5.1 was chosen as a compromise between functionality and user outreach. We still wanted to have updated features to use in android as well as reach the most number of people possible to help. We wouldn't want anything less than a 90% cumulative distribution, and so the latest APV we could have chosen was 5.1 with a cumulative distribution of 92.3%. Along with APV 5.0 being reported as one of Androids biggest updates and APV 5.1 being an update which fixed alot of bugs in the previous version, APV 5.1 was a good choice. The logging files were made so that everyone who wanted to see what was newly updated about the project would be able to easily read about it instead of being suprised later on while coding. Those who saw a change they didn't like would be able to view and explanation for the change from the notes made before to prevent any assumptions. Lastly, the example file was made so everyone would have the same basic format and finding information would be easy.
