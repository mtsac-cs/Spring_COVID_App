<---SPECIFIC EXAMPLE--->
2 April 2020

	-Updated the UI of the home page by increasing the button size from 35dp x 35dp to 48dp x 48pd and darkening the hue of the button colors.
	-The change in button size was was done in order to give users a better experience as a smaller button could lead to misclicks or missing. This change was also done to better align with the standard minimum button size of 48dp x 48pd. The change in the hue was done because the colors seemed too bright and did not suit the overall layout of the app that well.
